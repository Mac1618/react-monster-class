type of learning: 
1. fully focus            - rest 5 mins to 10 mins
2. with medium rests      - rest 10 mins to 30 mins
3. with long rests        - rest is same lenght of learning or even longer

3 HOURS CHALLENGE (reactjs monster class)
  - from:   7:20 pm     (1:55:58)
  - to:     10:20 pm    (2:10:00)

1. proper git commits, pr, and branching

2. UseState

3. PORTAL
  - is a feature that allows you to render a child component into a DOM note that exists outside the heirarchy of the parent component. These can be useful for scenarios like:
    a. modals
    b. tooltips
    c. dropdowns
  where you want to break out of the usual parent-child structure and render in a different part of the DOM.

  - to:     05:00 pm (2:55:00)

3. PORTAL
  - commonly used to popup, modals, alerts, dialog to render outside of the root element. Sometimes it's used for login/registration, notification, Image and Video Lightboxes basically anything that can popup on the screen.

4. useState
  - use to render a state on first render
    a. if dependency array is not provided:     - it will render on each reload.
    b. if dependency array is provided:         - reloads if dependecies changes.
    c. condition only works inside the useEffect.

5. <StrictMode></StrictMode>:
  - causes to render twice (you can test in useEffect)
  - inside the main.jsx

  - to:     01:09 am (3:40:00)

6. fetch  
  - using fetch need to add await for fetching and getting the response. See sample on hook -> use-effect -> 03-assignment -> FetchDataEffect.jsx

7. Context API
  - Context API is a feature that allows you to manage and share state across your component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level. It's useful for scenarios where you need to share data or functions across many components, especially when these components deeply nested

    // basically the parent   
    a. const FormContext = createContext(), <FormContext.Provider> </FormContext.Provider> (e.g 02-assignment)
      - FormContext has 2 attributes. "Provider" and "Consumer"
      - "Provider": we are providing the value to pass
    
    // children component
    b. import {FormContext}, <FormContext.Consumer> </FormContext.Consumer>
      - how we will consume or use the data.
    
    c. context api needs to use createContext() multiple times to pass a data. Sample in 04-context -> 02-assignment

8. useContext()
  - useContext allows us to access the context values provided by the context object directly within a functional component. Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass pross down manually at every level.
    a. alternative and much better approach on "Consumer" e.g. "<FormContext.Consumer>"
    b. sample in 04-context -> 03-assignment

9. conditional with .trim()
  - removes the whitespaces in a string.
    a. with conditional:
      --- sample ---
      const username = "   username   "; 
      if (username.trim()) {
        // logic here
      }

      --- description --- 
      - if "username" empty or has a space "   ", will return false
      - if "username" has a value other than space "value", will return true

10. pr description  
  a. template:          
    - ## üî• What‚Äôs New?, 
    - ## ‚úÖ Checklist, 
    - ## üß™ How to Test, 
    - ## üìù Related Issues, 
    - ## üí¨ Notes for Reviewers

11. useReducer()
  - is a hook that is similar to useState, but it is designed for more complex state objects or state transitions that involves multiple subvalues. It allows you to manage states in a functional, Immutable way.

    a. sample structure of a useReducer()
    - const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState)

    b. definition of terms
    - "state":      - The current state value, which you can use in your component.
    - "dispatch":   - A function you call to send  actions to the reducer, which then updates the state.
    - "reducer"     - This is a function that describes how the state should change based on actions. It takes the curret state and an actions as inputs, and returns a new state.
    - "initialState"  - This is the starting value for the state when the component first renders.

12: useRef()
  - useRef Hook proves a way to access and "interact with DOM" elements or to persist values across renders without causing a re-render.

1. Custom Hooks
  - Custom Hooks are javascript functions that start with a prefix "use" (e.g., useFetch useForm) and can call other hooks within them. They allow you to "extract and reuse logic" that involves state or side effects, making your component more readable and maintainable

2.  "try, catch" vs "then, catch"
    a. "try, catch" 
      - developers preferred try catch for readability and easy to manage your logics
    b. "then, catch"
      - alternative to try catch but basically the same. 
      - good to know: you can use .then from 1st one to 2nd one.
        - e.g. fetch("link.com.ph")           // response.data.data
                .then((layerOne) => layerOne) // 1st layer
                .then((layerTwo) => layerTwo) // 2nd layer

3. useId hook
  - this hook in React is used to generate unique IDs for components

1. concat
  - used to stick together, works with "string" and "arrays"
  - sample: 
    a.  const hello = "Hello, ";
        const name = "Mark!";
        const greeting = hello.concat(name);    - // "Hello, Mark!"
    
    b.  const fruits = ["üçé", "üçå"];
        const veggies = ["ü•ï", "ü•¶"];
        const food = fruits.concat(veggies);    - // ["üçé", "üçå", "ü•ï", "ü•¶"]

2. eval()
  - executes a javascript argument with string format.
  - NOTE: executing javascript in a string is BIG SECURITY RISK. Don't use in real world applications
